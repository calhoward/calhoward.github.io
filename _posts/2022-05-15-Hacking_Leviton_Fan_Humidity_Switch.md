## Introduction

The [Leviton](https://www.leviton.com) *[IPHS5-1LW](https://www.leviton.com/en/products/iphs5-1lw)* in-wall humidity sensor & fan control is a neat, novel method of controlling your bathroom fan. The humidity sensor turns the fan on when humidity is sensed, and then shuts off when ambient humidity returns to normal. This is certainly useful as a modern convenicence, as well as a clever energy-saving device. 

As dandy as this little switch is, it's smart, but it's not *smart*. By *smart*, I mean *internet-of-things* smart. Unfortunately, this device's automation routines are subject and limited to its own local decision-making, and cannot be externally influenced nor read from. Alas, this can be fixed.

With some reverse engineering and hacking, we can get this switch online and connected to our home automation server by integrating its logic with an [Espressif](https://www.espressif.com/) *[ESP8266](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266)* Wi-Fi MCU. Once connected, we can even interface with it using smart assistants like Alexa, Siri, and Google Home. 

## Analyzing the board

The first step in reverse-engineering a circuit is to take a glance at the board and find the main logic ICs. In this case, I identified the [Microchip](https://www.microchip.com/) *[PIC16F1823](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/PIC16F1823-I-SL/2258580)* 8-bit microcontroller IC as the main logic processor used in the Leviton *IPHS5-1LW* switch. The *PIC16F1823* will be our main target for analyzing and hacking the circuit's logic.

*Fig. 1 - Photo of the IPHS5-1LW logic board*

Pictured above (*Fig. 1*) is a close-up shot of the low-voltage logic board found in the Leviton *IPHS5-1LW*. The larger 14-pin IC in the top-right is the *PIC16F1823*. From this image, we can see several empty through-hole pads used for testing/probing in the factory where the board is assembled. These can be useful as probing points, as some of these have traces leading directly to the SMD pins on the *PIC15F1823*. 

Of course, the [datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/PIC12LF1822-16LF1823-Data-Sheet-40001413F.pdf) will tell us everything we need to know about each of the the I/O pins, as shown in the following diagram and chart pulled from the datasheet:

*Fig. 3 - PIC16F1823 pin allocation table*

This key shows us where the power pins, `VSS` (voltage source) and `VDD` (voltage drain), are located. From here, we just need to isolate the pins that are responsible for the logic of the relay driver and for the logic of the activation button. To do this, we will have to test probe the circuit while it is live.

## Probing the circuit

>!! DANGER !! Exposing live house wiring while also exposing live, disassembled AC wiring devices is extremely dangerous *and possibly lethal*. Do not do this.
{: .prompt-danger }

To locate the pins that control the fan and the button, I used my digital multimeter set to DC voltage to listen for the 3.3v logic on each general-purpose I/O pin, taking note of which pin I'm on by refrencing the pinout diagram and pin allocation diagram.

*Exposing the logic board while circuit is powered*

After careful probing, I found the fan control logic output at `RC5`. This pin normally outputs 0.0v (`LOW`) while the fan is off, and outputs 3.3v (`HIGH`) when the fan is running. After further careful probing, I found the button logic pin at `RA0`. This pin normally outputs 3.3v (`HIGH`), and changes to 0.0v (`LOW`) when the button is closed/depressed.

With the logic found and analyzed, it's time to move on to the next step, soldering in our mod wires.

## Soldering in wires

For ease and for modularity's sake, I opted to use male pin header jumper wires (with one end cut off for board soldering) to connect to the logic board. These male header pins will be ran out through the side of the black plastic case that houses the logic and relay board in the IPHS5-1LW, making use of the factory cutout.

*Holding the circuit and mod wires using helping-hand clamps*

After careful soldering to `VSS`, `VDD` and `RA0` via the through-hole pads, as well as `RC5` via direct solder to the SMD pin of the IC, our little header wire is ready for action. All that's left is to re-assemble the case and start interfacing with the switch.

## Buttoning it up

Voil√†! The *IPHS5-1LW* is fully re-assembled and with exposed headers to leads `VSS` (3v3), `VDD` (ground), `RA0` (button), and `RC5` (fan relay driver) on the *PIC15F1823* microcontroller.

*The fully packaged IPHS5-1LW with modded signal wires added*

With the relevant logic channels exposed, the next step is to use the exposed channels to interface with an *[ESP8266](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266)* board in order to achieve control of the circuit via Wi-Fi. 

## To be continued...

This guide will be expanded to include *ESP8266* programming and adding Wi-Fi control in the future. Check back soon.
