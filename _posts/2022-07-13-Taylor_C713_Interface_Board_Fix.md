## Preface

This write-up is the first in my new series I'd like to call, *Taylor C713 Headbanging*. Join me as I dive deep down the rabbit hole of repairing [Taylor](https://www.taylor-company.com/) soft serve machines (yes, the notorious, ever-faulty, engineered-to-fail brand of machines known for being broken at McYouKnowWho's).

To start off the series, I'd like to detail one hell of a fix— a true hack involving circuit modification— that I successfully performed on a faulty [C713](https://www.taylor-company.com/en/product-detail/model-c713) unit. 

## Introduction

After a particularly stormy weekend in coastal Georgia, I received a Monday morning service call about a broken soft serve machine. Thunderstorms always make me nervous, and afterwards I knew I was bound to hear from somebody with (now) faulty equipment. 

**The issue: one side of the machine isn't dispensing anything, the other side won't stop running.**

Great, I think to myself, as I re-assure the store manager everything will be fine. *I have no idea what's causing the issue or how to fix it.* Time to get digging.
